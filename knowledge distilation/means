1st: loss = a*loss_t + b*loss_s,  loss_t and loss_s are all Cross Entropy Loss.
2nd: loss = a*loss_s + b*loss_L1,  loss_s is Cross Entropy Loss, loss_L1 between teacher output with student output by L1 loss.
if output of teacher model is different from student's, teacher model was converted in accordance with student's.
